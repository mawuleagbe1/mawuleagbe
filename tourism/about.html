           <p class="mount">Mount Afadja, known as Afadjato to the Ewe people of Ghana and Togo, is one of the <br> highest mountains in Ghana. 
            The summit is located in the Volta Region, near the border <br> with Togo, close to the villages of Liati Wote and Gbledi Gbogame in the Afadjato South 
            <br> District and Hohoe Municipality, respectively. It is about 178 kilometers (111 mi) <br> northeast of Accra, and 178 kilometers (111 mi) 
            northwest of Lomé. Part of the Agumatsa <br> sub-range of the West Africa Mountains, its summit is often cited at 885 metres <br> (2,904 ft) above sea level,
            but in reality is only 587 metres (1,926 ft). The summit of Mount Aduadu <br> (746 metres (2,448 ft)) lies 3.5 kilometers (2 mi) to the east,  while Ghana's
            highest peak, Leklata, <br> lies about 4.6 kilometers (2.9 miles) to the east The mountain's name is "Afadja," while the suffix <br> "-to" in the Ewe language 
            means mountain. The correct name in the English language, therefore, <br> would be "Mount Afadja", not "Mount Afadjato", which would be a repetition of the word "mountain" <br>
            and the correct name in the French language would be "Mont Afadja", not "Mont Afadjato".</p>

        <p class="mount">The Adomi Bridge (originally the Volta Bridge) is a latticed steel arch suspension bridge <br>
            crossing the Volta River at Atimpoku in Ghana in West Africa. It is the first permanent <br>
            bridge to span the Volta River, which drains south into the Gulf of Guinea, and is Ghana's <br>
            longest suspension bridge. It provides the main road passage, just south of the Akosombo Dam, <br>
            between the Eastern Region and the Volta Region of Ghana. It was opened in 1957 by Kwame Nkrumah, <br>
            Ghana's first president. The iconic crescent-shaped arch bridge is featured in Ghanaian stamps and currency.</p>

            <p class="mount">Kakum National Park, located in the coastal environs of the Central Region of Ghana, <br>covers
                an area of 375 square kilometres (145 sq mi). Established in 1931 as a reserve, <br>it was gazetted as a national 
                park only in 1992 after an initial survey of avifauna <br> was conducted. The area is covered with tropical forest.
                The uniqueness of this park <br> lies in the fact that it was established at the initiative of the local people and
                not by the <br> State Department of wildlife who are responsible for wildlife preservation in Ghana. <br> It is one of only
                3 locations in Africa with a canopy walkway, which is 350 metres <br>(1,150 ft) long and connects seven tree tops which
                provides access to the forest.</p>

            The Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park and Mausoleum is located in downtown Accra, <br>
            the capital of Ghana. Over the years, the park has attracted visitors from around the world, <br>with an annual count of approximately 
             98,000 individuals who visit to pay homage to <br>Ghana's first President, and learn about his life and legacy.
            As one of the top 10 <br>most visited sites in the country, the park holds immense cultural and historical <br>significance The mausoleum, originally designed by Dr. E. G. A. Don Arthur, is <br>the centerpiece of the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park and houses the final remains of <br> the first President and his wife, Fathia Nkrumah.
